Use the following best practices to structure the content. When adding content to an existing article, follow the existing structure whenever possible.

Provide initial context. Define the topic and state its relevance to the reader.
Structure the content in a logical order by importance and relevance. Place information in order of priority, and in the order users will need it.
Avoid long sentences and paragraphs.
Introduce concepts one by one.
Use one idea per paragraph.
Use one idea per sentence.
Emphasize the most important information.
Begin each sentence or paragraph with the most important words and takeaways.
When explaining a concept, start with the conclusion, then explain it in more detail. (This is sometimes called an "inverted pyramid.")
When explaining a complex topic, present readers with the basic information first, and disclose the details later in the article.
Use meaningful subheadings. Organize related paragraphs into sections. Give each section a subheading that is unique and that accurately describes the content.
Consider using in-page links for longer content. This allows readers to jump to areas of interest and skip content that is irrelevant to them.
